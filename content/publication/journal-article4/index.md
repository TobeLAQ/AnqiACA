abstract: We compared baseline CSF GAP-43 levels (n = 730) and longitudinal CSF GAP-43 changes (n = 327) in various biological stages of AD, and investigated their relationships with cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of residual hippocampal volume, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, regional gray matter volume and cortical thickness, and cognition. Elevated CSF GAP43 levels were significantly associated with faster rates of hippocampal atrophy, AD-signature hypometabolism and cortical thinning, and middle temporal gray matter atrophy-related and AD-signature hypometabolism-related cognitive decline. In contrast, baseline levels of all these neurodegeneration biomarkers did not predict longitudinal CSF GAP-43 increases.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: These findings suggest that presynaptic loss may occur prior to neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of lowing tau aggregation and tau-related synaptic dysfunction in elderly adults and AD patients.
