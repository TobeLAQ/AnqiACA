abstract: Increased presynaptic dysfunction measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43) may be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how CSF GAP43 increases relate to AD-core pathologies, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in AD requires further investigation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Tau aggregations rather than AÎ² plaques primarily drive presynaptic dysfunction measured by CSF GAP43, which may lead to sequential neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in AD or neurodegenerative diseases.
